# Task C3: `microdb`, A Relational Query Engine

**Difficulty:** Very complex

## Working agreement (read this first)

- This folder is the project root. Do not read or write anything outside it.
- Python 3.11 and `pytest` are available. Use the **standard library only**. Do not install
  any third-party package and do not access the network.
- Do not use `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `ast`, `eval`, `exec`, or any parser generator. The lexer,
  the parser and the evaluator must be your own code.
- Create **exactly** the files listed under *Deliverables*. Do not add extra files
  (no `README.md`, no `requirements.txt`, no `pyproject.toml`, no scratch files).
- Do not ask clarifying questions. If something is genuinely ambiguous, choose the most
  reasonable interpretation, implement it, and record the choice in a short code comment.
- When the deliverables satisfy the acceptance criteria, stop.

## Goal

Implement an in-memory relational query engine: a value model with SQL-style three-valued
logic, a schema layer, a lexer, a parser for a small query language, an expression
evaluator, aggregate functions, a planner and an executor, plus a CLI that runs queries
against CSV files.

The hard part is not the parsing. It is keeping **NULL semantics, aggregation and ordering
mutually consistent** across a dozen interacting rules. Read section 3 twice.

## Deliverables

```
microdb/__init__.py        # public surface, __all__
microdb/errors.py          # exception hierarchy
microdb/value.py           # value model, three-valued logic, comparison, arithmetic
microdb/schema.py          # Column, Table
microdb/lexer.py           # tokenize
microdb/parser.py          # parse -> Query
microdb/expr.py            # expression evaluation
microdb/aggregate.py       # aggregate functions
microdb/planner.py         # Query -> Plan

microdb/__main__.py        # CLI, runnable as `python -m microdb`
tests/test_microdb.py      # your own test suite, at least 40 test functions
```

No other files. `tests/` needs no `__init__.py`.

## 1. Value model

There are exactly five value kinds. NULL is not a type, it is the absence of a value and is
permitted in a column of any type.

| kind | Python representation | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INT` | `int` | |
| `FLOAT` | `float` | |
| `TEXT` | `str` | |
| `BOOL` | `bool` | |
| NULL | `None` | |

**`BOOL` is a distinct type. `True` is not an `INT`**, even though Python reports
`isinstance(True, int)` as true. Any code that decides a value is numeric must exclude
`bool` explicitly.

`value.py` must export:

```python
def type_of(v: object) -> str          # "INT" | "FLOAT" | "TEXT" | "BOOL" | "NULL"
def is_numeric(v: object) -> bool      # True for int and float, False for bool and None
```

## 2. Three-valued logic

A logical value is `True`, `False`, or **UNKNOWN, represented by `None`**.

```python
def and_(a: bool | None, b: bool | None) -> bool | None
def or_(a: bool | None, b: bool | None) -> bool | None
def not_(a: bool | None) -> bool | None
```

Complete truth tables. Note that `AND` with a `False` operand is `False` even when the other
operand is UNKNOWN, and `OR` with a `True` operand is `True` even when the other is UNKNOWN.

| a | b | `a AND b` | `a OR b` |
|---|---|---|---|
| T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | T |
| T | U | **U** | **T** |
| F | T | F | T |
| F | F | F | F |
| F | U | **F** | **U** |
| U | T | **U** | **T** |
| U | F | **F** | **U** |
| U | U | U | U |

`NOT T = F`, `NOT F = T`, **`NOT U = U`**.

## 3. Comparison and arithmetic

### 3.1 Comparison

```python
def compare_eq(a: object, b: object) -> bool | None
def compare_lt(a: object, b: object) -> bool | None
```

1. If either operand is NULL the result is **UNKNOWN**, for every comparison operator,
   including `=` between two NULLs. `NULL = NULL` is UNKNOWN, not TRUE.
2. `INT` and `FLOAT` compare numerically with each other.
3. `TEXT` compares with `TEXT` by Unicode code point, using Python's own `<` on `str`.
4. `BOOL` compares with `BOOL` only, and `False < True`.
5. Any other type pairing raises `TypeMismatchError`. In particular `BOOL` against a number
   and `TEXT` against a number both raise.

### 3.2 Arithmetic

```python
def arith(op: str, a: object, b: object) -> object     # op in "+-*/%"
def negate(a: object) -> object
```

1. If either operand is NULL the result is **NULL**.
2. Operands must both be numeric (`INT` or `FLOAT`). `BOOL` and `TEXT` raise
   `TypeMismatchError`. There is no string concatenation with `+`; use `concat()`.
3. `+`, `-`, `*`: `INT` with `INT` yields `INT`; any `FLOAT` operand yields `FLOAT`.
4. **`/` always yields `FLOAT`**, even for two `INT` operands. `7 / 2` is `3.5`.
5. `%` requires two `INT` operands, otherwise `TypeMismatchError`. It follows Python's sign
   rule, so `-7 % 3` is `2`.
6. **Division or modulo by zero yields NULL, not an error.** This applies to `/` with a
   zero of either type and to `%` with a zero.
7. `negate` requires a numeric operand and preserves its type. `negate(None)` is NULL.

## 4. Schema

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
class Column:
    name: str
    type: str        # "INT" | "FLOAT" | "TEXT" | "BOOL"

class Table:
    def __init__(self, name: str, columns: list[Column], rows: list[list[object]]) -> None
    @property
    def name(self) -> str
    @property
    def columns(self) -> list[Column]
    @property
    def rows(self) -> list[list[object]]
    def column_index(self, name: str) -> int      # SchemaError if unknown
```

`Table.__init__` validates and raises `SchemaError` when:

1. `columns` is empty;
2. a column name repeats (comparison is **case sensitive**, so `a` and `A` may coexist);
3. a column `type` is not one of the four type names;
4. a row length differs from the column count;
5. a non-NULL cell does not match its column type. `BOOL` cells accept only `True` and
   `False`; an `INT` column rejects `True`; a `FLOAT` column **accepts an `int`** and stores
   it converted to `float`; an `INT` column rejects a `float`, including `3.0`.

Rule 5's `FLOAT` widening is the only implicit conversion anywhere in this task.

## 5. Query language

Clause order is fixed. Keywords are case insensitive; identifiers are case sensitive.

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] select_item [, select_item]*
FROM table_name [ [INNER | LEFT] JOIN table_name ON expr ]
[WHERE expr]
[GROUP BY expr [, expr]*]
[HAVING expr]
[ORDER BY expr [ASC | DESC] [, expr [ASC | DESC]]*]
[LIMIT int]
[OFFSET int]
```

- `select_item` is `expr [AS alias]`, or `*`, or `table_name.*`.
- Only the clauses listed exist. There are no subqueries, no `UNION`, no `CROSS JOIN`,
  and at most one `JOIN`.

### 5.1 Lexical rules

1. Whitespace separates tokens. `--` starts a comment to end of line.
2. Integers are digits. Floats are `digits.digits` or `digits.` or `.digits`; a float may
   carry an exponent (`1e3`, `1.5E-2`). `1.` is a valid float, unlike in some languages.
3. Text literals use single quotes; a literal single quote is written `''`. Newlines are
   allowed inside a text literal.
4. Identifiers match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. A qualified reference is `ident.ident`.
5. Keywords: `SELECT DISTINCT FROM INNER LEFT JOIN ON WHERE GROUP BY HAVING ORDER ASC DESC
   LIMIT OFFSET AS AND OR NOT IS NULL TRUE FALSE`. Keywords are matched case insensitively
   and are never identifiers, so a column may not be called `order`.
6. Operators: `= <> < <= > >= + - * / % ( ) , .`
7. Anything else is a `LexError` carrying a zero-based character offset.

### 5.2 Expression grammar, lowest precedence first

```
or_expr      := and_expr (OR and_expr)*
and_expr     := not_expr (AND not_expr)*
not_expr     := NOT not_expr | predicate
predicate    := additive ( (= | <> | < | <= | > | >=) additive
                         | IS NULL | IS NOT NULL )?
additive     := multiplicative ((+ | -) multiplicative)*
multiplicative := unary ((* | / | %) unary)*
unary        := - unary | primary
primary      := INT | FLOAT | TEXT | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
              | ident | ident . ident
              | ident ( arg_list? )
              | ( or_expr )
```

**A predicate is not associative**: `1 < 2 < 3` is a `ParseError`. `IS NULL` and
`IS NOT NULL` are postfix and take the place of a comparison.

`NOT` binds **looser than comparison**, so `NOT a = b` parses as `NOT (a = b)`.

## 6. Scalar functions

Case insensitive names. Wrong arity raises `ArityError` naming the function and both counts.

| call | result |
|---|---|
| `concat(a, b, ...)` | at least 2 args, all `TEXT` or NULL; **NULL if any argument is NULL** |
| `upper(s)`, `lower(s)` | `TEXT` or NULL, NULL propagates |
| `length(s)` | `INT` number of code points, NULL propagates |
| `abs(n)` | numeric, type preserving, NULL propagates |
| `coalesce(a, b, ...)` | at least 1 arg; **first non-NULL argument, else NULL**; the only function that does not propagate NULL |

A non-NULL argument of the wrong type raises `TypeMismatchError`. An unknown function name
raises `UnknownFunctionError`.

## 7. Aggregates

Names are case insensitive: `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`.

1. `count(*)` counts **rows**, including rows that are entirely NULL. It is the only place
   `*` may appear inside a call.
2. `count(expr)` counts rows where `expr` is **not NULL**.
3. `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max` **ignore NULL inputs entirely**.
4. Over a group with no non-NULL input: `count` is `0`, and **`sum`, `avg`, `min` and `max`
   are all NULL**. `sum` of nothing is NULL, not `0`.
5. `sum` yields `INT` when every summed value is `INT`, otherwise `FLOAT`.
6. **`avg` always yields `FLOAT`**, and divides by the count of non-NULL values.
7. `min` and `max` preserve the input type and use the section 3.1 ordering. Mixing `TEXT`
   with numbers inside one aggregate raises `TypeMismatchError`.
8. `sum` and `avg` require numeric input; `TEXT` or `BOOL` raises `TypeMismatchError`.
9. Aggregates may not nest. `sum(count(x))` is a `ParseError`.

## 8. Execution order

This is the specification's core. Stages run in exactly this order:

```
1. FROM and JOIN      produce the working rows
2. WHERE              keep rows whose predicate is TRUE
3. GROUP BY           form groups
4. aggregate          evaluate aggregates per group
5. HAVING             keep groups whose predicate is TRUE
6. SELECT             evaluate the projection, apply aliases
7. DISTINCT           remove duplicate output rows
8. ORDER BY           sort
9. OFFSET then LIMIT  slice
```

Consequences you must honour:

1. **`WHERE` and `HAVING` keep a row only when the predicate is TRUE.** UNKNOWN and FALSE
   both drop it. This is why `WHERE a = NULL` returns nothing.
2. A predicate that is not a logical value raises `TypeMismatchError`. `WHERE 1` raises,
   because `1` is `INT`, not `BOOL`.
3. **`WHERE` cannot see aliases** defined in `SELECT`; `ORDER BY` can.
4. **`WHERE` cannot contain an aggregate**; that is an `AggregateError`. `HAVING` may.
5. `ORDER BY` runs **after** `DISTINCT`, so it may only reference output columns when
   `DISTINCT` is present; without `DISTINCT` it may also reference input columns.
6. `OFFSET` is applied before `LIMIT`.

### 8.1 Joins

- `INNER JOIN` keeps a pair only when the `ON` predicate is TRUE.
- `LEFT JOIN` emits every left row at least once; when no right row makes the predicate
  TRUE, the right columns are all NULL.
- Output column order is all left columns then all right columns.
- Row order is left-major: for each left row in input order, its matches in right input
  order.
- An unqualified column name that exists in both tables raises `AmbiguousColumnError`.
  A qualified name `t.c` where `t` is neither table raises `UnknownTableError`.

### 8.2 Grouping

1. Two grouping keys are equal when every component is equal, **treating NULL as equal to
   NULL**. This is the one place NULL equality is reflexive, and it differs deliberately
   from `=` in section 3.1.
2. **Group output order is the order in which each group's first row appears** in the input.
   Do not sort groups.
3. With `GROUP BY` present, a `SELECT` item that is neither an aggregate nor one of the
   grouping expressions raises `GroupingError`.
4. **With no `GROUP BY` but at least one aggregate in `SELECT` or `HAVING`, the whole input
   is one group, and exactly one row is produced even when the input is empty.**
   `SELECT count(*) FROM empty` yields one row containing `0`.
5. With no `GROUP BY` and no aggregate, projection is row by row.
6. Grouping by an expression is allowed, for example `GROUP BY length(name)`.

### 8.3 Ordering

1. Sort keys apply left to right.
2. **NULL sorts after every non-NULL value, in both `ASC` and `DESC`.** `DESC` reverses the
   order of non-NULL values only; NULLs stay last.
3. The sort must be **stable**: rows that compare equal on every key keep their relative
   order from stage 7.
4. Comparing incompatible types inside a sort raises `TypeMismatchError`.
5. `ORDER BY` may reference an output alias. When an alias has the same name as an input
   column, **the alias wins**.

## 9. Public API

```python
def execute(query: str, tables: dict[str, Table]) -> Result
```

`Result` is a frozen dataclass with `columns: list[str]` and `rows: list[list[object]]`.
Output column names are the alias when given, otherwise the column name for a bare column
reference, otherwise the source text of the expression with all whitespace collapsed to
single spaces, for example `count(*)` or `a + b`.

`planner.py` must expose `plan(query: Query) -> Plan` and `Plan` must be a sequence of named
stage objects, so that a caller can inspect the pipeline without executing it.
`executor.py` must expose `execute_plan(plan: Plan, tables: dict[str, Table]) -> Result`.

## 10. Errors

`errors.py` defines exactly this hierarchy:

```
MicroDBError(Exception)
├── LexError(MicroDBError)              # .offset
├── ParseError(MicroDBError)            # .offset
├── SchemaError(MicroDBError)
├── TypeMismatchError(MicroDBError)
├── UnknownColumnError(MicroDBError)
├── AmbiguousColumnError(MicroDBError)
├── UnknownTableError(MicroDBError)
├── UnknownFunctionError(MicroDBError)
├── ArityError(MicroDBError)
├── AggregateError(MicroDBError)
└── GroupingError(MicroDBError)
```

`LexError` and `ParseError` carry a zero-based `offset` attribute.

## 11. CLI

`python -m microdb --table NAME=PATH [--table NAME=PATH] QUERY`

- A CSV file's first line is a header of `name:TYPE` pairs, for example `id:INT,name:TEXT`.
- An **empty field is NULL**. A field of `''` (two quote characters) is the empty string.
- `BOOL` fields accept `true` and `false`, case insensitively.
- Output is CSV on stdout: a header line of output column names, then the rows. NULL is
  written as an **empty field**, so a single NULL column renders as an empty line.
  `True` and `False` are written lowercase. Floats use `str()`.
- **Quoting rule, applied per field**: a field is wrapped in double quotes only when it
  contains a comma, a double quote or a newline, and an inner double quote is doubled.
  Do not quote a field just because it is empty. Lines end with a single `
`.
- Exit codes: `0` success; `2` usage error (bad arguments, missing `--table`, unreadable
  file, malformed header); `3` any `MicroDBError`, with the message on stderr.
- Nothing is written to stdout on a failure path.
- `main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int` returns the exit code and
  `python -m microdb` passes it to `sys.exit`.

## 12. Your own tests

`tests/test_microdb.py`, at least **40** test functions, runnable with `python -m pytest -q`.
Cover at minimum: the three-valued truth tables, `NULL = NULL` being UNKNOWN, division by
zero yielding NULL, `sum` of an empty group being NULL, `count(*)` over an empty table
yielding one row, NULLs grouping together, NULLs sorting last under `DESC`, sort stability,
`LEFT JOIN` NULL filling, alias visibility in `ORDER BY` but not `WHERE`, and the CLI exit
codes.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `python -m pytest -q` passes from this folder.
2. `python -c "import microdb; print(len(microdb.__all__))"` works.
3. This runs and prints `2`:
   ```
   python -m microdb --table t=people.csv "SELECT count(*) FROM t WHERE age > 30"
   ```
4. Every public function and method has type annotations on parameters and return value.
5. **No function body is longer than 60 lines.**
