# Task A3 — Group-and-Aggregate

**Difficulty:** Atomic

## Working agreement (read this first)

- This folder is the project root. Do not read or write anything outside it.
- Python 3.11 is available. Use the **standard library only** — do not install any third-party
  package and do not access the network.
- Create **exactly** the files listed under *Deliverables*. Do not add extra files
  (no `README.md`, no `requirements.txt`, no scratch or notes files).
- Do not ask clarifying questions. If something is genuinely ambiguous, choose the most
  reasonable interpretation, implement it, and record the choice in a short code comment.
- When the deliverables satisfy the acceptance criteria, stop.

## Goal

Aggregate a list of sales records by region.

## Deliverables

- `sales.py`

## Public API

```python
def summarize(rows: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    ...
```

## Specification

Each input row is a `dict` that may contain the keys `"region"` and `"amount"`.
Other keys are ignored.

### Region handling

1. The region value is `str(row["region"]).strip()`.
2. Rows are grouped **case-insensitively**: the group key is the region lowercased.
3. The `"region"` reported for a group is the **stripped value as it first appeared** in the
   input for that group. For example, rows with `" North "`, `"north"`, `"NORTH"` in that order
   form one group reported as `"North"`.
4. If `"region"` is missing, or is `None`, or is blank after stripping, raise `ValueError`
   with message exactly `row <i>: missing region`, where `<i>` is the **0-based** index of
   the offending row in the input list.

### Amount handling

5. The amount value is taken from `row.get("amount")`. It is treated as `0.0` when it is
   missing, `None`, or a string that is empty or whitespace-only.
6. Otherwise it is coerced with `float(value)`. Leading/trailing whitespace in strings is
   acceptable (`" 12.5 "` → `12.5`).
7. If coercion fails, raise `ValueError` with message exactly
   `row <i>: invalid amount: <repr>`, where `<i>` is the 0-based row index and `<repr>` is
   the Python `repr()` of the original value. Example: `row 3: invalid amount: 'abc'`.
8. `bool` amounts are not special-cased — `True` coerces to `1.0`.

### Output

9. Return a `list` of `dict`, one per group, each with exactly these four keys in this order:
   `"region"` (`str`), `"count"` (`int`), `"total"` (`float`), `"avg"` (`float`).
10. `count` is the number of rows in the group, including rows whose amount was `0.0`.
11. `total` is the sum of the group's amounts, rounded with `round(value, 2)`.
12. `avg` is `total_before_rounding / count`, rounded with `round(value, 2)`.
13. The result is sorted by `total` **descending**; ties are broken by `region` **ascending,
    case-insensitively**.
14. `summarize([])` returns `[]`.
15. The input list and its dicts must not be mutated.

## Requirements

1. `sales.py` must define no other public names. Helper names must start with `_`.
2. Importing `sales` must have no side effects.
3. Validation happens in input order: the first offending row raises, and a missing region
   is reported before an invalid amount on the same row.

## Acceptance criteria

```python
summarize([
    {"region": "North", "amount": "100"},
    {"region": "south", "amount": 50.5},
    {"region": " NORTH ", "amount": " 25 "},
    {"region": "South", "amount": None},
]) == [
    {"region": "North", "count": 2, "total": 125.0, "avg": 62.5},
    {"region": "south", "count": 2, "total": 50.5, "avg": 25.25},
]

summarize([]) == []
summarize([{"region": "a", "amount": 10}, {"region": "b", "amount": 10}]) == [
    {"region": "a", "count": 1, "total": 10.0, "avg": 10.0},
    {"region": "b", "count": 1, "total": 10.0, "avg": 10.0},
]
```

`summarize([{"amount": 1}])` raises `ValueError("row 0: missing region")`.
`summarize([{"region": "x", "amount": "abc"}])` raises `ValueError("row 0: invalid amount: 'abc'")`.

## Definition of done

`sales.py` exists in this folder and every item under *Acceptance criteria* holds.
